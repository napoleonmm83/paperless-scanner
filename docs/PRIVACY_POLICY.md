# Privacy Policy for Paperless Scanner

**Last updated: January 2026**

## Overview

Paperless Scanner ("the App") is designed with privacy as a core principle. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.

## Data Collection

### What we DO NOT collect:
- Personal information
- Usage analytics

### What the App stores locally:

- **Authentication Token**: Your API token for accessing your Paperless-ngx server
- **Biometric Preference**: Whether you've enabled biometric authentication

All data is stored securely on your device using Android's encrypted DataStore.

## Data Transmission

The App only communicates with:
- **Your Paperless-ngx Server**: Documents you scan are uploaded directly to your self-hosted server
- **Google ML Kit**: Document scanning uses on-device processing (no cloud upload)

## Third-Party Services

### Google ML Kit Document Scanner
