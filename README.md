## 🔒 Privacy Model

**The base app sends your documents ONLY to your own Paperless-ngx instance.**

| Component | Where data goes |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Scanned documents | → YOUR Paperless server |
| Credentials | → Android Keystore (local) |
| Analytics | → Nowhere (zero tracking) |
| Crash reports | → Nowhere |

**No cloud. No LLM. No third parties.**

### Premium AI Features (Optional)

If you subscribe to Premium (€4.99/month):
- Document images are sent to Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite for tag suggestions
- You review and confirm all suggestions before upload
- Not stored permanently (per Google's API terms)

**If you don't subscribe:** The app works 100% self-hosted. Zero external services involved.

### Security Measures

- 🔐 Credentials encrypted with Android Keystore
- 🔒 HTTPS enforced for remote connections
- 🛡️ Certificate pinning support
- 🔑 Token-based authentication (no password storage)
- 🔓 Open source - audit the code yourself

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>How much does the app cost?</strong></summary>

The app costs **CHF 1.- (one-time purchase)** via Google Play. This includes all core features: scanning, uploading, document management, offline mode, and more. Optional Premium AI features are available as a subscription for power users.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need a subscription?</strong></summary>

No, you don't need a subscription to use the app. The one-time purchase (CHF 1.-) gives you full access to all core features. The optional Premium subscription (€4.99/month) adds AI-powered suggestions to save you time.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is Paperless-ngx?</strong></summary>

[Paperless-ngx](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx) is a community-supported, open-source document management system that helps you scan, index, and archive all your physical documents. You need to host your own instance (or use a hosted solution) to use this app.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use my own AI instead of the Premium subscription?</strong></summary>

Yes! If you're technically savvy, you can set up [Paperless-GPT](https://github.com/icereed/paperless-gpt) or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint and configure it in the app settings. This is the "Power-User" option mentioned in our features.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why does the scanner require Google Play Services?</strong></summary>

The app uses MLKit Document Scanner, which is distributed via Google Play Services. This provides the best scanning experience with automatic edge detection and perspective correction. If you're on a device without Play Services, the app won't work (yet - we're considering alternatives).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does the app work offline?</strong></summary>

Yes! You can scan documents offline, and they'll be queued for upload. Once you're back online, the app will automatically sync them to your Paperless instance.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I scan multi-page documents?</strong></summary>

Absolutely! After the first scan, tap "Add Page" to scan additional pages. The app will combine them into a single PDF before uploading.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What data does the AI see?</strong></summary>

If you subscribe to Premium, the app sends the scanned document image to Google's Gemini AI for analysis. The AI returns suggestions for tags, title, date, and correspondent. Google doesn't permanently store your documents after processing. [Read more in our Privacy Policy](docs/PRIVACY_POLICY.md).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Where can I report bugs or request features?</strong></summary>

Open an issue on our [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/napoleonmm83/paperless-scanner/issues). We appreciate detailed bug reports with steps to reproduce!
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this with Paperless (old version) instead of Paperless-ngx?</strong></summary>

No, this app is designed specifically for Paperless-ngx. The original Paperless project is deprecated. We recommend [migrating to Paperless-ngx](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/setup/#migrating-from-paperless).
</details>

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Login Issues

**Problem:** "Unable to connect to server"

- ✅ Check your server URL (must include `http://` or `https://`)
- ✅ Verify your Paperless-ngx instance is running
- ✅ Test the connection in a browser: `https://yourserver.com/api/`
- ✅ Check firewall rules if using local network
- ✅ For HTTPS with self-signed certs, install the CA certificate on your device

**Problem:** "Invalid credentials"

- ✅ Double-check username and password
- ✅ Try logging in via web interface to verify credentials
- ✅ Check for extra spaces in username/password fields

### Scanning Issues

**Problem:** "Scanner not available"

- ✅ Make sure your device has Google Play Services installed
- ✅ Update Google Play Services to the latest version
- ✅ Check device compatibility (Android 8.0+ required)

**Problem:** "Poor scan quality"

- ✅ Use good lighting conditions
- ✅ Place document on contrasting background
- ✅ Hold device steady and parallel to document
- ✅ Use the manual crop option if auto-detect fails

### Upload Issues

**Problem:** "Upload failed"

- ✅ Check your internet connection
- ✅ Verify you're still logged in (token might have expired)
- ✅ Check Paperless-ngx server logs for errors
- ✅ Try uploading a small test document first

**Problem:** "AI suggestions not appearing"

- ✅ Verify your Premium subscription is active
- ✅ Check internet connection (AI requires online access)
- ✅ Check if you've exceeded the fair use limit (see Settings → Subscription)

### Performance Issues

**Problem:** "App is slow or crashing"

- ✅ Clear app cache: Settings → Apps → Paperless Scanner → Clear Cache
- ✅ Check available storage space
